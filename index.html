        <h2><u>BIOGRAPHY</u></h2>
        <p><span class="span"><b>Virat Kohli</b></span> ( born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer and the former captain of the Indian national cricket team. <br> Who plays as a right-handed batsman for <b>Royal Challengers Bangalore</b> in the IPL and for Delhi in Indian domestic cricket.</p><br>
        It became a no-brainer when he was asked to captain the Bangalore franchise on a permanent basis from 2012 and it also translated into more consistency with the bat. Kohli soon turned into a fan favourite even as runs flowed from his bat and eventually becoming the leading-run scorer in the history of IPL. Circa, 2016 - the India and RCB captain blasted 973 runs - the most by any player in the history of the game and it included four hundreds - the most by a batsman in a single edition. Alas, all this didn't translate into a title triumph - one that has kept Kohli and Bangalore waiting so far (As of March 2023). <br>
